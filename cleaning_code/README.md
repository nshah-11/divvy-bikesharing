## Data Cleaning and Preparation Process 

### Raw Dataset Sample 
Here is a sample of the raw dataset:

### Findings Overview
The original dataset, consisting of over 5.7 million trips, had approximately 25% missing data, particularly missing start/end station names and start/end latitude and longitude data. Detailed data analysis revealed three key observations: 1) according to Divvyâ€™s program there are only two bike types, (E-bikes and Classic bikes); however, our dataset revealed a third type of Docked bikes; 2) Over 99% of missing data involved E-bikes; and 3) anomalies such as extra characters in station names, multiple coordinates for one station, and inactive stations for testing purposes were observed.

### Relevant Cleaning Steps 
1. Columns related to ids (ride_id, start_station_id, end_station_id) were removed. 
2. All Docked bike observations were converted to Classic bikes.
3. Trips with missing latitude/longitude were removed as they lacked analytical value and did not skew the distribution of other variables such as member type and bike type.
4. Observations with missing station names for classic bike trips were treated as lost/stolen and removed.
5. Observations with remaining missing station names for all E-bike trips were replaced with "Locked at e-station/public rack"
6. Station names and latitude and longitude coordinates were cleaned and aligned with another dataset that contains a list of about 900 active station names

### Feature Engineering 
Based on existing attributes, addtional variables were created: 
| Attribute                            | Description                                                             | 
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Date                | Date bike ride was taken - date           | 
| Day of Week              |7 days of the week (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday etc.) - string     |
| Month            | Month of the year (January, February etc.) - string      | 
| Season                   | Season of the year (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter) - string   | 
| Start Time                   | The time the bike ride started - time   | 
| End Time                   | The time the bike ride ended - time   | 
| Trip Duration (mins)   | The total time of the bike ride - integer    | 

### Cleaned Dataset Sample

After cleaning the dataset, there are approximately 5.2 million observations for 2023.

## Navigating This Section 

Either file version below can be used to produce the same clean dataset.
- cleaning_data(with EDA): this is a messy version of cleaning the data which includes some preliminary EDA & notes 
- cleaning_data(clean): this is a clean version of cleaning the data

After cleaning the dataset, to add additional variables: 
1. Run extract_dates.py
2. Then run add_fields_pt2 in python

This will produce the final cleaned dataset!
