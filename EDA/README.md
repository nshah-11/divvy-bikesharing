## Univariate Analysis 

The univariate analysis was done using Tableau.

A majority of bike rides were locked at e-station/public rack. Since these do not necessarily correspond to one location (based on coordinates recorded) these were excluded from our analysis.

Most bike rides are during the summer with the least during winter. It appears there may be a seasonal trend as well.

There is approximately an even distribution of bike rides throughout the days of the week with Sundays and Mondays having the lowest amount of bike rides.

Most bike rides have a trip duration of 5 mins. The average trip duration is 14.5 minutes. The minimum trip duration was 2 minutes with a maximum of 179 mins. Even after removing trips that are less than 1 minute and greater than 180 mintues, it appears there are still some outliers. But for our analysis, they will not be removed.

Most rides start and end at during 5PM. The lowest amount of rides taken are during the early morning hours (1am to 5am).

Approximately 50% of riders use electric bikes and 50% use classic bikes. Approximately 2/3 of riders are members.
